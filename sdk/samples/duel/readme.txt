To play multiplayer one machine hosts a game, the others join.

To play using TCP/IP over the Internet, the people who are joining the
game must enter the IP address of the machine that hosted the game.
You can find out the IP address of your machine by running "winipcfg".
If you have a net card and a modem installed, you will need to make
sure you read the IP address of the modem connection to the Internet.
The modem will show up as a "PPP Adapter".  DirectPlay will not work
through proxies or firewalls.

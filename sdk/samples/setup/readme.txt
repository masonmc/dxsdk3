Setup

This sample is an example of how to use DirectXSetup API's to install
DirectX subsystem and DirectX drivers.  It also serves as a working template
for ISV's to install a game.
                                                          
Note that this program will not run until the redist directory (on the CD)
is copied into the same directory as setup.exe.  The whole tree must be
copied in order to setup correctly.

This is a basic example to show how to use DirectDraw palettes.

4 separate DirectDrawPalette objects are created, and they can be attached
to the primary surface just by selecting a menu item.    Any given palette
can be cycled through its red values.  The palettes can be created in
exclusive mode or not.

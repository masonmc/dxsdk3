This program demonstrated clipped blting and stretched clipped blting.  It 
is a non-exclusive mode application that displays a rotating donut in a 
window.  Clipped blting can be demonstrated by moving another window partially
or completely in front of the stretch window.  The rotating donut does not 
overwrite the clipping window.

The size of the rotating donut can be changed with menu selections.  Any
other size than 1x1 demonstrates stretch blting.  The window can also be 
resized by grabbing any one of the corners with the mouse.

Another menu option can be used to change the rate of rotation of the donut.

This is not an exclusive mode application and so it is incapable of setting
the display mode.  Therefore, it must be executed on an 8 bit per pixel 
display.  It will not work correctly with other pixel depths.

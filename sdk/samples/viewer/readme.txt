Direct3DRM Object Viewer
Copyright (C) 1995, 1996 Microsoft Corporation. All Rights Reserved.

This is a stand alone D3DRM app that allows you to load and view 3d
objects.

The initial scene has a light source in the top right. To see this the
view can be moved backwards and forwards using the T and R
keys. Additional objects can be loaded from the file menu, and new
light sources can be added from the lights menu.  Objects can be
rotated with the left mouse button and dragged with the right.

The last object that was rotated or dragged remains the current
selection.

The device quality can be altered using the Renderer menu. Using this
menu the type of device used can also be switched from ramp to
RGB. When using the RGB device the color of lights in the scene can be
changed in the same way as you change the color of objects. In 256
color mode it is advisable to dither an RGB device for best results.

The DirectX documentation in this directory contains the same information
as the WinHelp documentation in the WinHelp directory of this SDK. The
WinHelp format of the documentation is generally easier to use than the Word
format because of its many hypertext links and other navigational aids.

Before printing any of the Word documentation, you should rebuild the table
of contents for that file so that the page numbers are accurate for your
printer. To do this, select the table of contents in Word, right-click the
selection, and then click Update Field. In the Update Table Of Contents
dialog box, click the Update Entire Table option, and then click OK.

The Word format of the Direct3D documentation is provided in several
files so that the file sizes are more manageable. (The Direct3D
documentation appears as one section in the WinHelp format.)
